## ABOUT ME
_____________________________________________________________________

Tech and Innovation lover. During my experience I had the opportunity to develop knowledge in 
relation to technological progress, devices and acquire a broad understanding of knowledge areas 
related to software development and new technological advances.

Passionate about learning about new cultures, their languages, structure and other important 
aspects such as broadening perspectives and interacting with new ideas and approaches.

I have very diverse interests, from a wide interest in sports, reading, to even considering 
myself a nature lover and discovering new experiences that contribute to my continuous learning.
